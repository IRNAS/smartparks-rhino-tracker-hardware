Device is composed from 3 different PCBs thah are stacked in to box like shape.

Stackup of PCBs is in this order:
- GPS (Top PCB)					Size: 28mm x 20mm 
- MCU (Side PCB)				Size: 28mm x 20mm (After final assembly)
- LORA ANTENNA (Side PCB)		Size: 28mm x 15.5mm
- BATTERY (Between side PCBs)

PCB specifications:
- 0.8mm PCB thinknes
- 0.152mm (6mil) trace to trace and trace to polygon clearance
- 0.75mm RF line thinknes

Connections between PCBs:
- MCU -> GPS - Solder pads on each PCB
- MCU -> LORA antenna - Coaxial cable
