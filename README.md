# SmartParks Rhino Tracker
<img src="https://github.com/IRNAS/smartparks-rhino-tracker-hardware/blob/master/11_DOC/irnas_logo.png" height="100">

Device is composed from 3 different PCBs thah are stacked in to box like shape.

Stackup of PCBs is in this order:
- GPS (Top PCB)					Size: 28mm x 20mm 
- MCU (Side PCB)				Size: 28mm x 20mm (After final assembly)
- LORA ANTENNA (Side PCB)		Size: 28mm x 15.5mm
- BATTERY (Between side PCBs)

PCB specifications:
- 0.8mm PCB thinknes
- 0.152mm (6mil) trace to trace and trace to polygon clearance
- 0.75mm RF line thinknes

Connections between PCBs:
- MCU -> GPS - Solder pads on each PCB
- MCU -> LORA antenna - Coaxial cable

Future changes:
- GPS
	- Reposition of GPS antenna to the center of the PCB
	- Better power supply for GPS (Lower working voltage)
	- Improve GND polygon for better GPS antenna performance

- MCU
	- Optimize track path for antenna
	- Change PCB orientation in final assembly like so that MCU is under battery
	- Optimize hardware for battery voltage measure
	- Move REED switch closer to the MCU

- Mehanical Specification:
	- Device dimensions 32x24x27mm
	- Device weight: ~30g
	- Device is put in polyurethane resin to protect it (https://si.farnell.com/electrolube/ur5640rp250g/resin-pur-packet-250g-transparent/dp/2786027)
	- Inside of the device and around the battery there is pa peace of plastic for:
		- Keeping the gap between battery na LORA antenna eqalu on all devices assebled
		- Preventing the resin to go under the MCU metal case (There was a problem with RF radio when resin came under matel case of MCU)
		- Preventing the resin to go under GPS BGA chip (There was a problem when resin came under BGA and coused cold solder joints)
	- Resin thinknes arount the device is 2mm
